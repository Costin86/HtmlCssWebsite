                The traditional Romanian dish is more than just Romanian cabbage rolls. Though these stuffed cabbage rolls are delicious,
                 the Romanian dessert is underrated in Romanian cooking and Romanian recipes.
                And although Romania is indeed the home to Vlad Tepes and the myth of Dracula, there are plenty of other reasons to visit, such as the cuisine! 
                Although traditional Romanian food isn’t very well-known, it offers a great variety of delicacies that are worth discovering, and you will be
                 pleasantly surprised at the myriad of flavors and dishes. 
                So whether you want to learn more before your visit to Romania, or whether you are simply curious about its cuisine, we have compiled a list with 
                the top 10 most popular dishes from Romania, so you can get an idea of what Romanian cuisine is all about! 
                Before jumping into the Romanian dishes we’ve listed, it’s worth saying a little more about Romanian cuisine in general. 
                With Romania being a country that is situated at the crossroads of Central, Easters, and Southeastern Europe, the cuisine has collected a large variety
                 of influences that have brought with their different flavors and ingredients, to make Romanian food rich and filling. 
                 
                Some of the main influences of Romanian food are Balkan, Turkish, Serbian, German, and Hungarian cuisines. As a general rule, Romanian food is very savory, 
                and there is something for everyone if you know where to look. 
                It is worth noting that while some cuisines are known for being healthy and nutritious, Romanian food very much isn’t so.
                In fact, most Romanian dishes are heavy and filling, with plenty of calories and not the healthiest of ingredients. 
                However, Romanian cuisine makes up for this in the flavor and taste of the food, as it is truly delicious, and almost every meal can be considered a treat. 
                It is also important to remember that most Romanian dishes come from an old rural tradition, and the best versions of the food are those that are home-made in small rural areas, with the recipes having been handed down many generations.
                So although restaurants will offer great food, it might not be as good as if you went to a food establishment with homemade meals and dishes for authenticity. 

 


    
         <h3>Wine</h3>

         Romania is one of the world's largest wine producers and fifth-largest among European wine-producing countries, after Italy, France, Spain, and Germany.
          Similar in size to wine-producing countries such as Chile and Portugal but lesser-known on the world wine stage. In 2018 it produced around 5.2 million
           hectolitres of wine. In recent years, Romania has attracted many European business people and wine buyers, due to the affordable prices of both 
           vineyards and wines compared to other wine-producing nations such as France, Germany, and Italy.
         Romania's most cultivated grape varieties are for white wines Fetească Albă, Fetească Regală, Riesling, Aligoté, Sauvignon, Muscat, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay,
          Tămâioasă Românească, Grasă de Cotnari, Galbenă de Odobești. Also, the main grape varieties for red wines are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Băbească Neagră, 
          Romania has one of the oldest wine-making traditions in the world and its viticulture dates back more than 6,000 years. Due to suitable climate, relief and soils, 
          viticulture became a current activity of the local inhabitants mainly in the hilly areas. Numerous local wine grape varieties have been obtained during medieval 
          time by empirical selection, becoming representatives for Romanian wine regions. Up to the phylloxera crisis, each Romanian wine region had its own wine grape assortment,
           that generated specific local wines. Since the medieval period, wine has been the traditional alcoholic beverage of the Romanians.[citation needed]
        In the 1880s phylloxera (a pale yellow sap-sucking insect that attacks the roots of vines) was introduced accidentally also in Romania (1872, Chitorani, Dealul 
        Mare wine-growing region), and over a period of several years destroyed the local viticulture. Restoration of the Romanian viticulture lasted until the beginning of the 20th
    century, and was done mainly by planting French wine grape varieties such as Merlot, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon, Cabernet Sauvignon etc. Besides these, 
    phylloxera-resistant grape hybrids were also planted. Several traditional Romanian wine grapes did survive the phylloxera crisis, and are still cultivated in Romania in the 21st Century.
        Romania has about 187,000 hectares of vine plantations; that ranks it on sixth place between the European wine-producing countries. With a wine production of about 4.5 million hl/year, 
        The wine grape assortments of Romanian wine-growing regions encompasses many varieties for white, red and aromatic wines.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGxjEe2s-QI" title="YouTube video player"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> Each wine-growing region has its own traditional grape varieties: 
        Zghihara de Husi and Busuioaca de Bohotin for the Huși wine-growing region; Fetească neagră for the Iași wine-growing region; Grasa de Cotnari and Frâncușa for the Cotnari wine-growing region;
         Crâmpoșie for the Drăgășani wine-growing region; Băbeasca Neagră for the Nicorești wine-growing region; Iordană și Ardeleancă for the Târnave wine-growing region; or Mustoasă de Măderat for 
         the Miniș wine-growing region.
    Each wine-growing region additionally cultivates international wine grape varieties, mainly: Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling italico, Pinot gris and Traminer for white
     wines; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot noir for red wines. All these local and international varieties form the basis of many wines, presented mainly under the
      name of the wine grape variety (e.g. Sauvignon, Feteasca albă, Tămâioasă românească) and less commonly under the name of producer (e.g. DAVINO, ALIRA, LACERTA) or under
       a marketing name (e.g. Serafim, Bon Viveur, Gramma, René Faure etc.).Romania is the thirteenth largest wine-producing country in the world.Fetească Neagră, Pinot Noir.
